# Arduino ESP8266 mini board version v2.0

1. Completely changed sketch. Modded version of Stooges combined with mine.
Now there is no need for any changes in ps4's network set up! Just login and 
go!<br><br>

2. ESP8266 Board specs can now be display, how much space you're using, how much is left, etc.<br><br>

3. Files can be FTP'd into the ESP in REAL time while connected to ps4. You can upload, download
 delete,  thanks to the file manager!
<br><br>

4. Configure wifi settings of ESP8266 right from the ps4 or via phone, pc etc<br><br>

5. Can work through USER GUIDE and/or browser either way or both!<br><br>

6. ALL addresses put in browser url lead to the INDEX page of the exploit! Unless
they are EXPLOIT specific pages!<br><br>

7. various minor changes here and there<br><br>

<b>ADDED:</b><br>
+ Admin panel to the main exploit/index page as a secondary way to access the ADMIN page.<br>
now it can be access via a browser on a device connected to the ESP or directly from the exploit.
(note: that some options on the ADMIN page will NOT work through the ps4 browser. Must use PC, Phone<br>
etc.  for those options to work)<br><br>
